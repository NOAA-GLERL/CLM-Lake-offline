# CLM-Lake-offline
tools and processed lake-wide data for CLM-Lake offline runs 

- R scripts generate graphics and skill and simulation comparison statistics

- lake-wide temperature, evaporation and ice cover are reported in the `data` directory as csv files

- gridded depth is available as netCDF (data is sparse--most of CONUS is land, not lake)
